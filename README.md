Currently looking for new opportunies to make things work.

This is a place I put some of my code, thoughts, and TILs.  Mostly it keeps me from losing anything.

I am an [aphant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) and [cross-dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dominance) handed.  I like to eat pickles, listen to audiobooks, learn new technologies, and spend time with my family.

#### Hi. Hello. Hola. ä½ å¥½. Saluton.
This is a place to put most of my code, thoughts, and [TILs](https://github.com/benjaminmetzler/TIL).  I am a software engineer with over 20 years of experience, holding roles along the development process, with an emphasis on automating and making things work in short periods of time.

I am an [aphant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) and [cross-dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dominance) handed.  I enjoy listening to audiobooks, learning new technologies, and spending time with my family.
